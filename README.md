SUV car purchase prediction

Here is the data set : https://www.kaggle.com/iamaniket/suv-data. It contains a number of features and we have to predict if a customer with a given set of features will 
purchase the SUV or not. Here I have used multiple algorithms to comapre the accuracy output of each algorithm and found that SVM provides the highest accuracy.

I am a begginner in Data Science and I would absolutely love some feedbacks :)
